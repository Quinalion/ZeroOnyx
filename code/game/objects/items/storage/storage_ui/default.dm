// `default` storage UI represents the main storage interface system in the game.
// It supports two modes, slot-based storage and space-based storage.
//
// Slot-based storage uses item slots, where each item takes exactly one slot.
// It is rendered as a series of 32x32 boxes that are arranged into rows.
// Each row contains up to 7 slots. If there are more than 7 slots in a storage
// and they are occupied, additional rows will be stacked vertically until all the
// items are placed.
//
// Space-based storage uses a single storage space with fixed capacity denominated in "storage cost".
// Items take space based on their storage cost which grows exponentially with their "w_class".
// This means that you can either store a lot of small items or a couple of larger item, e.g. 6 syringes or 1 crowbar.
// Space-based storage is rendered as a single horizontally scaled screen object that represents total storage,
// and a series of smaller horizontally scaled screen objects representing space taken by each stored item.
